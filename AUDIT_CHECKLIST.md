## 🚧 REMAINING ISSUES TO FIX

### 4. GitHub URLs (NEEDS FIX ❌)
**Problem:** Many docs still reference old `deewcee/NuVision-News` instead of `dcthedeveloper/NuVision-News2.0`

**Files with wrong URLs:**
- README.md (badges, git clone, contact section)
- docs/EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md
- docs/USER_GUIDE.md (2 locations)
- docs/API_REFERENCE.md
- docs/USER_DOCUMENTATION.md
- ITAI2373-NewsBot-Final/docs/* (copies of above)

**What needs changing:**
- `https://github.com/dcthedeveloper/NuVision-News2.0` → `https://github.com/dcthedeveloper/NuVision-News2.0`
- `https://github.com/dcthedeveloper` → `https://github.com/dcthedeveloper`

**Impact:** Low (links work but point to different repo)
**Priority:** Medium (should be correct for submission)

## ✅ VERIFIED ACCURATE

### Context Lens Description
- ✅ Correctly describes "Why This Story?" recommendation explanations
- ✅ NO false claims about Student/Analyst/Executive modes
- ✅ Matches actual implementation in ContextLens.tsx

### Module Descriptions
- ✅ All Module A-D descriptions match actual code
- ✅ BiasRadarPage, KnowledgeMap, EventTimeline all exist
- ✅ Features claimed are actually implemented

### API Keys Security
- ✅ .env files in .gitignore
- ✅ No API keys in git history
- ✅ Only placeholders in .env.example

### Package.json
- ✅ Name: "nuvision-news"
- ✅ Version: "1.0.0"
- ✅ Professional metadata

## 📋 OPTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS (Not Critical)

### Dates Consistency
**Current state:** Some docs say "October 18, 2025", some say "October 2025", some say "October 28, 2025"
**Recommendation:** Standardize to "October 2025" (month/year only) since exact date doesn't matter
**Priority:** Low

### NewsAPI References (For Final Project)
**Current state:** Final project docs mention NewsAPI as *optional* live news feature
**Status:** This is actually CORRECT - the web app DOES have optional NewsAPI integration in src/lib/newsApi.ts
**Action:** Keep as-is (these are accurate)

---

## 🎯 ACTION PLAN

**Critical (Do Now):**
1. ❌ Fix all GitHub URLs: deewcee → dcthedeveloper

**Nice to Have (Optional):**
2. Standardize dates to "October 2025"

**No Action Needed:**
- Team attribution ✅
- Data source (midterm) ✅
- Evolution story ✅
- Feature descriptions ✅
- API security ✅

---

## 📊 CONFIDENCE LEVEL

**After fixing GitHub URLs:** 95% confidence everything is accurate

**Remaining 5% uncertainty:**
- Minor wording variations across docs (acceptable)
- Some docs more detailed than others (acceptable)
- Dates slightly inconsistent (not critical)

**Bottom Line:** After GitHub URL fix, documentation is submission-ready! 🎉
