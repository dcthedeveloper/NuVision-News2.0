# NuVision News 2.0

NuVision is an intelligent news intelligence platform that aggregates reporting, surfaces multi-perspective analysis, and provides fast, explainable NLP-driven summaries and insights.

This repository contains a React + TypeScript frontend (Vite) and a small Node-based inference proxy used to securely access the Hugging Face Inference API for summarization and other NLP tasks.
